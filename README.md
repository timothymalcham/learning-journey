# Learning Journey

What I'm working on learning. Documenting it here for some reason. 


## THE LIST


#### Languages

Goal: learn lower-level programming languages to become a better programmer overall. 

I have lots of experience with higher-level, dynamic languages (python, javascript, php), but I've grown more interested in different programming approaches lately. 

Learn these at a slightly deeper level than surface-level. Eventually, pick one to become an "expert" in.
