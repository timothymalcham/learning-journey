# Learning Journey

What I'm working on learning. Documenting it here to see the journey unfold. 


## THE LIST


### Highest Priority to Learn Right Now:
- Pre-Algebra & Algebra
- Low-level game dev & graphics programming


### Math

I suck at math, for now at least. I almost always got F's and D's in math during middle/high school. 

Learning through Khan Academy and Brilliant.

These things, in particular, I want to work up to and learn:

- [ ] Pre-algebra (yeah, that's how little I know)
- [ ] Algebra I
- [ ] Algebra II
- [ ] Pre-calculus
- [ ] Calculus
- [ ] Trigonometry
- [ ] Linear Algebra


### Languages

Goal: learn lower-level programming languages to become a better programmer overall. 

I years of experience with higher-level, dynamic languages (Python, JS/typescript, PHP), but I've grown more interested in different programming approaches lately. Mainly, lower-level stuff.

Learn these at a slightly deeper level than the surface level. Eventually, pick one to become an "expert" in. 

- [ ] Learn C (Pikuma courses)
- [ ] Learn C++ (The Cherno YT vids)
- [ ] Learn Go 
- [ ] Learn Assembly


### Pikuma Courses 

Goal: learn low-level fundamentals of game dev.

- [ ] 3D Graphics Programming from Scratch **(16%)**
- [ ] Understanding Bitshift Operations
- [ ] Raycasting Engine Programming 
- [ ] Game Physics Engine Programming
- [ ] C++ 2D Game Engine Development


### Casey Muratori's Performance-Aware Programming Series

Goal: understand how to write fast code, how CPU/hardware runs programs

- [ ] Online Video Course


### Unreal Engine

Goal: learn to build well-crafted games in UE.

- [ ] Tom Looman UE Course


### Web dev

Goal: I still need to grow my skills as a web developer for contract work, making money, building products, etc. Specifically, I want to learn how to build web apps in Go. 

- [ ] [Let's Go!](https://lets-go.alexedwards.net/)


### Comp Sci / Misc Programming

Goal: Level up general programming/comp-sci skills by learning through creating.

- [ ] Algorithms / Data Structures in C++ (Udemy Course)
- [ ] Writing An Interpreter In Go (Book)
- [ ] Build Your Own Redis with C/C++ (Book)
- [ ] Build Your Own Database From Scratch (Book)
- [ ] From Source Code To Machine Code (Book)


### Art / Design / 3D / writing

- [ ] Perspective
- [ ] Color Theory
- [ ] Blender (modeling, rigging, etc.)
- [ ] Learn to write well-crafted stories
- [ ] Learn to write comedy/humor
- [ ] [Learn how to write shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com/00/)
- [ ] [Learn 3D Game Shaders](https://lettier.github.io/3d-game-shaders-for-beginners/)
- [ ] [Learn OpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/)

# THE JOURNEY:

## June 2023

#### Foundational math courses (Khan Academy)

This is what I'm doing:

I've started to devote 2 hours a day to studying. 1 hour for math, 1 hour for programming/comp-sci related learning. 

This month I've been working on basic math skills, working through The Cherno's C++ YT videos, and starting the Let's Go book.
