# Learning Journey

What I'm working on learning. Documenting it here for some reason. 


## THE LIST


### Math

I suck at math, for now at least. I almost always got F's and D's in math during middle/high school. 

Learning through Khan Academy and Brilliant.

Per a recommendation on `r/learnmath` from someone going to school for math, use Khan Academy, but start at grade 1 and go from there to make sure you don't miss anything foundational. So, that's what I'm doing. 

Theses things in particular I want to work up to and learn:

- [ ] Pre-algebra (yeah, that's how little I know)
- [ ] Algebra I
- [ ] Algebra II
- [ ] Pre-calculus
- [ ] Calculus
- [ ] Trigonometry
- [ ] Linear Algebra


### Languages

Goal: learn lower-level programming languages to become a better programmer overall. 

I have lots of experience with higher-level, dynamic languages (python, javascript, php), but I've grown more interested in different programming approaches lately. 

Learn these at a slightly deeper level than surface-level. Eventually, pick one to become an "expert" in. 

- [ ] Learn C (Pikuma courses)
- [ ] Learn C++ (The Cherno YT vids)
- [ ] Learn Go 
- [ ] Learn Scala
- [ ] Learn Zig
- [ ] Learn Rust


### Pikuma Courses 

Goal: learn low-level fundamentals of game dev.

- [ ] 3D Graphics Programming from Scratch **(16%)**
- [ ] Understanding Bitshift Operations
- [ ] Raycasting Engine Programming 
- [ ] Game Physics Engine Programming
- [ ] C++ 2D Game Engine Development


### Casey Muratori's Performance-Aware Programming Series

Goal: understand how to write fast code, how cpu/hardware run programs

- [ ] The course


### Unreal Engine

Goal: learn to build games well in UE.

- [ ] Tom Looman UE Course


### Misc Programming

Goal: Level up general programming skills by learning through creating.

- [ ] Writing An Interpreter In Go
- [ ] Build Your Own Redis with C/C++
- [ ] Build Your Own Database From Scratch
